// // Project Description: This project either takes in a file and reads from it or takes user input if no file is given and then stores it into a temporary file to read from.
// //   This file is then scanned over to find all identifiers, integers, keywords, and operators, which are then parsed over to make sure they fit the criteria given for our language.
// //   While the different tokens are being parsed, they will be put into a tree so we can access them through nodes for later additions to the project.  They will also
// //   be displayed as a tree to showcase what exactly we are looking at for our tree (through preorder traversal).
